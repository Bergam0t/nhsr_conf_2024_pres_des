# Part 1: Pathways

## Pathway Simulation: Why?

:::: {.columns}

:::{.column width="40%"}

![](resources/long_hospital_queue.jpeg){height=400px fig-alt="A stylised image showing very long queues outside of a hospital building"}

:::

:::{.column width="60%"}

Your emergency department is struggling.

You could try a range of different things...

::: {.incremental}
- increase the number of staff available to register, triage or treat
- increase the number of rooms or beds
- increase the rate at which tests can be processed

:::

:::

::::

:::{.incremental}
- add a new step in the process with a different kind of practitioner
- completely redesign the pathway
:::

:::{.fragment .center}
**Which of these is the right answer?**
:::

## Queue, Queue, Barney McGrew

Healthcare tends to be **full** of queueing problems like this one.

::: {.incremental}
- People attending a walk-in clinic or emergency department
- People calling a telephone-based service like 111 or a mental health crisis line
- People on a cancer diagnosis and treatment pathway
- People waiting to be assessed for ADHD and Autism, or on the waiting list for a gender clinic
- People waiting for a series of treatment with a mental health practitioner
    - might have one, several or many appointments
:::

## Pathway Parts

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=50%}

Healthcare systems are full of **resources**

::: {.incremental}
- People 👩🏻‍⚕️ 👩🏿‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👨🏽‍⚕️ 👩🏾‍⚕️
- Equipment 🔬🩺
- Rooms & cubicles 🏥
- Beds 🛌🏻 🛌🏽 🛌🏿 🛌🏻 🛌🏼 🛌🏽 🛌🏿
- Treatments 💉 🩹 💊
- Vehicles 🚑 🚁 🚗
:::

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

::: {.fragment}

These **resources** experience demand from **entities**.

These entities might be

:::

::: {.incremental}
- People (in person) 🤒 🤢 🤧
- People (on the phone) ☎️
- Test Requests 🩻 🧪
:::

:::

::::

## Pathways and Queues


::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=23%}
As these entities move through a pathway - a series of steps where these resources are used - queues can build up where there isn't enough resource.
:::

:::{.column width=7%}
:::

:::{.column width=70%}
![](assets/2024-11-18-10-12-15.png){fig-alt="A pathway showing several steps, starting with 'sign in with receptionist'. One person is signing in; one receptionist is in use and the other is available. A queue of 7 people is then waiting to be triaged. One person is being triaged bby the single available triage nurse. The pathway then splits; one person is seeing a nurse for treatment while two further nurses are available. There is no queue for this step. However, 8 people are waiting to be treated by the single available doctor, who is currently treating someone. People can then either be discharged, receive additional treatment from a nurse or doctor, or may require additional tests. One person is waiting for tests; one person is dealing with the tests while the other is idle. After these tests, people may be discharged, or may need to see a doctor or nurse again."}
:::

## Queue What?

```{=html}
<br/>
```

And these pathways are often very **complicated**!

There are lots of moving parts, and lots of variation.

## The Problem with Pathways

Making changes to pathways can be

- costly
- slow
- unsafe!

:::{.fragment}
And even if you do fix the original problem you were trying to solve, there's a risk of knock-on effects elsewhere in the pathway that you didn't foresee.
:::

## The *Future* Problems with Pathways

And even if you avoid that....

A system that is coping now might *not* cope

:::{.incremental}
- all the time
- if demand increases
- if resource temporarily decreases
:::


## It's All a Simulation


On HSMA, we teach a couple of different **computer simulation** techniques.

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="27%" .fragment}

### System Dynamics

High-level technique that's often suited to uncovering fundamental issues with pathway or wider healthcare system design

:::

::: {.column width="5%" .fragment}

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:600px"></div>
```

:::


::: {.column width="30%" .fragment}

### Agent-Based Simulation (ABS)

Individual-level modelling that is particularly interested in the impact of individuals' decisions and interactions

:::


::: {.column width='5%' .fragment}

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:600px">
</div>
```

:::



::: {.column width="33%" .fragment}

### Discrete Event Simulation (DES)

Modelling focussing on the flow of entities through a pathway and use of resources, allowing detailed investigation of capacity, queues and waits

:::

::::



## It's Our DEStiny

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=25%}
</br></br>
What we generally want to tackle our **pathway** problems in healthcare is **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)**<br/>

:::


:::{.column width=5%}
```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:700px"></div>
```
:::

:::{.column width=70%}

::: {.center}

In a DES...
:::

![](assets/2024-11-18-09-41-27.png){fig-alt="The top row of this diagram says 'entities' and shows stylised 'emoji' representations of 5 ill people. The next row of the diagram says 'flow through a pathway' and shows a branching diagram of a healthcare pathway with the steps 'arrive', 'sign in with receptionist', 'triaged', 'see nurse', 'see doctor', 'additional tests', 'discharge'. Some steps are optional or may be repeated more than once - the specifics are not important as it is just an indication of what is meant by 'pathway' in this context. The final row says 'using resources along the way' and shows four doctors and three beds as an indication of what resources are in these context."}
:::

::::

## DES to the Rescue

DES is so powerful because it gives us an in-silico (computer-based) reproduction of our pathway to play around with.
<br/><br/>
We can make any change we want<br/>*(e.g. more resources, higher demand, new pathway design)*<br/>**safely and for free** and see what impact it has on any metric we care to measure:

- how long people wait at each step of the pathway
- people meeting targets (e.g. 4 hour wait)
- how much of the time the resources are utilised for
```{=html}
<br/><br/>
```
And so on!

## Variation

That randomness and variation in our healthcare systems that we mentioned before? DES can cope really well with that!

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=40%}

Let's imagine that people turn up to our system, on average, every 10 minutes.

However, sometimes no-one turns up for half an hour, and other times 3 people turn up simultaneously.

By using **distributions** we can produce random times that mimic real-world patterns.

:::

:::{.column width=60%}

![](assets/2024-11-19-17-04-14.png)

:::

::::

## Randomness

Taking it even further, we can harness that variation for making the most of our models.

```{=html}
<br/>
```

:::: {.columns  .fragment}

::: {.column width="45%"}

We can hold the random patterns consistent and **change resource levels or pathway design**

:::

::: {.column width="10%" }

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:250px"></div>
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%" }

We can hold resources or pathway design consistent and **allow randomness**

:::

::::


```{=html}
<br/>
```



:::: {.columns .fragment}

::: {.column width="45%" }

This allows us to be sure the changes we're testing really are responsible for the differences

:::

::: {.column width="10%" }

```{=html}
<div style="border-left:3px solid #fff;height:250px"></div>
```

:::

::: {.column width="45%" }

This allows us to test our system in multiple parallel universes, running it **tens** or even **hundreds** of times!

:::

::::


## A Note About Modelling

Your DES won't be a perfect one-to-one reproduction of the pathway you are modelling.

We have to make certain assumptions and simplifications, and we can't capture every complexity.

# Example DES Projects

## DES is popular!

- On the HSMA programme, we've had over 35 projects using DES in some capacity
<br/><br/>
- A third of the registered projects this year use DES
(as opposed to machine learning, ABS, system dynamics, natural language processing, geographical modelling)
<br/><br/>
- It's also frequently used in the [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) team

## Example 1: Bladder Cancer Pathway

In this [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) project, a DES model of the bladder cancer pathway at Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust (RCHT) exposed two key system bottlenecks.

- A delay between patients being referred and receiving their surgery
- A delay waiting for the nurse specialist to contact the patient to discuss their diagnosis and treatment options

The model was used to support an on-the-spot rewrite of the pathway, resulting in multi-week reductions to waiting times.

## Example 2: Vaccination Clinic

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at the design of a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in North Devon, exploring

- queue lengths
- car park capacity
- times for each step of the vaccination process

The model identified potential issues with the original proposed plans, and was used to refine the plans to enable a safe but efficient delivery of the vaccination programme.
<br/><br/>

## Example 3: Emergency Department Model

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project looked at ways to improve Urgent Treatment Care (UTC) performance. The team wanted to know

- What further staff and resources would be required for any variations in patient attendance
- How changes in the patient pathway would reduce bottlenecks</br> (e.g what would be the impact of front-loading diagnostics?)

The model identified a need for additional rooms and the ED was redesigned as a result.
<br/><br/>

## Example 4: Mental Health Assessment Pathway Model

This [PenCHORD](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-implementation/research-teams/penchord/) project created a simulation model of a mental health assessment pathway.

The trust in question was piloting an approach that would allow patients to book their appointments themselves.

The model was used to help

- predict the number of appointment slots required at each site
- show that allowing queue-sharing between smaller groups of sites would significantly reduce the wait times

[{{< fa globe >}} Find Out More](https://arc-swp.nihr.ac.uk/publications/scheduling-community-mental-health-assessment-in-devon/)


## Example 5: Children's Neurodiversity Assessment Pathway

This [HSMA](https://hsma-programme.github.io/hsma_site/) project created a model of a paediatric neurodevelopmental (ADHD + autism) pathway. Waits had increased to a 2 years on average.

The team wanted to understand

- where current bottlenecks in the process were
- what level of staffing would be needed to clear the existing backlog and maintain a steady state

The model showed that recruiting an extra lead clinician would not address the bottleneck - but an additional second assessor would.

# Activity

## DES Applications

In your groups, we're going to spend a few minutes discussing opportunities you can see for DES in your organisation.



# DES Step 1: Arrivals

## Recap - Controlled Randomness

As mentioned earlier, one great thing about DES is controlled randomness.

We can work out the average time between patients arriving at the centre - maybe every 5 minutes - but we don't want people to just turn up at exact 5-minute intervals.

That's not very realistic, and it doesn't help us understand how the system copes with variation.

## Distributions

We sample the gap between arrivals from a distribution.

Where the bar higher, there is a greater chance that the random number picked will be somewhere around that value.

![](assets/2024-11-25-13-04-09.png)

Depending on the real-world pattern we are trying to mimic, our distribution will be a different shape or peak in a different place.

# DES Step 2: A Simple Pathway


# DES Step 3: Branching Pathways


# DES Step 4: Optimising a Complex Pathway



# Doing your Own DES Projects

## Conceptual Modelling

DES models (and all data science and operational research projects!) work best when there's involvement from the start of staff involved with the pathway.

One of the key early steps of any DES project is **mapping the pathway**.

**TODO


## Drag & Drop

There are various paid, closed-source drag-and-drop software tools for doing DES - but they are often prohibitively expensive.

Using these tools can make it hard to share your models with others.

However, If you don't code, there is the free and open source (FOSS) tool [JaamSim](https://jaamsim.com/).

![](assets/2024-11-18-10-15-22.png){fig-alt="A screenshot showing the homepage of the website for the JaamSim software. It contains a link to download the software for free, as well as a video showing the use of the software and some key information about the features of the software."}

## Simulation Library

:::{.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
This is an early-stage piece of work!
:::

On HSMA, we're trying to collate and visualising models from across healthcare systems.

At present, there is

- A simple emergency department
- An orthopaedic surgery unit
- A simple community-based service with a single appointment
- A complex community-based service with varying numbers of appointments and a per-clinician caseload

More will be added in the coming months.

# End of Simulation

## Summary

- DES is an amazing option for tackling your pathway problems
<br/><br/>
- With ever-growing resources and community experience out there, it's a great time to get started
<br/><br/>
- FOSS libraries allow us to adapt and reuse models - but follow guidance to make it as easy as possible for people to stand on your shoulders!
